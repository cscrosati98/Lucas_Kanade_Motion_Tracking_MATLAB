# Lucas_Kanade_Motion_Tracking_-MATLAB
This is a Project from a Digital Image Processing Class I took at the University of the Pacific. 
This program was written in MATLAB and allows a user to select a window size and then a sequence of images. 
Once the sequence is selected the user is prompted to select 21 points to track on the initial image. 
Once completed the sequence is played back with motion tracking.
